                    We are interested in sharing our ideas about programming and discussing them with likeminded people around the globe. It could be about a specific 
                    programming language, where you would like to know more about the language itself and its uses. But it could also be about a certain project you are 
                    dealing with and want to get a different view on it. What we can create as a community is much larger than what you might create on your own. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Join our community and attend our meetups where you can discuss with others from around the world, get a different perspective and enjoy spending 
                    time with people just like you or why not completely opposite you.

                <h2>Meetups</h2>
                <p>
                    We arrange Meetups throughout the week.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Usually we will have a different topic for every meetup, check which one you would like to join and make sure you are not missing out!
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is no need to sign-up specifically for each meeting but to be able to attend them you need to sign-up to our community. That will give you access 
                    to our Slack and everything else that we do.

                <p>
                    The interest for programming is rapidly increasing in our society. For that reason we expect that some of you who are visiting here might not know so much about
                    programming, and that is okay! We will do our best to aid you and hopefully your interest will grow even larger.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the Programming-tab we present some of the most common programming languages where you can read more about them. This section will continue to grow 
                    to be even more extensive as we go along.
