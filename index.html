                Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating 
                and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software development involves writing and maintaining the source code, but 
                in a broader sense, it includes all processes from the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, typically 
                in a planned and structured process.[1] Software development also includes research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, 
                maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.

                Front-end developers create the user interface (UI) that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look.

                If someone wanted to build a website, for example, they might hire a front-end developer to create the site's layout. The front-end developer determines 
                where to place images, what the navigation should look like, and how to present the site. Much of their work involves ensuring the appearance and layout of 
                the site or application is easy to navigate and intuitive for the user.

                "I've always found crafting polished user interactions that surprise and delight users to be the most rewarding and engaging task," says Mari Batilando, 
                a software engineer at Meta. "In order to do this, you need to both have an eye for detail and a rock-solid understanding of the platform."

            <h2>Backend Developer</h2>
            <p>
                Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you canâ€™t see on a website. Back-end developers ensure 
                the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code 
                that helps browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a team, back-end developers collaborate with front-end developers, product managers, principal architects, and website testers to build the structure 
                of a website or mobile app. Back-end developers must be familiar with many kinds of tools and frameworks, including languages such as Python, Java, and Ruby. 
                They make sure the back-end performs quickly and responsively to front-end user requests.
